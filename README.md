BackboneKIT
===========

BackboneJS is a great tool to roganize Javascript code but miss some basic feature like **plugin support** and **inheritance**.
Inspiration comes from complex tools like ExtJS (aka Sencha) and i'm sure many of your will implement my code better!

BackboneKIT is an add-on script that alter the way BackboneJS do some stuff. 
You should use BackboneJS the way you know but under the cowling you have much power!

I didn't reinvent the wheel... just put elegant white tires on Backbone!

What come with the Kit?
=======================

* Inheritance
* Plugins support
* Global access to components
