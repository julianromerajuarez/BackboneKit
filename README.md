BackboneKIT
===========

BackboneJS is a great tool to roganize Javascript code but miss some basic feature like **plugin support** and **inheritance**.
Inspiration comes from complex tools like ExtJS (aka Sencha) and i'm sure many of your will implement my code better!

BackboneKIT is an add-on script that alter the way BackboneJS do some stuff. 
You should use BackboneJS the way you know but under the cowling you have much power!

I didn't reinvent the wheel... just put elegant white tires on Backbone!

## What comes with BackboneKit?

* Inheritance
* Declarative Events
* Plugins Support
* Global Access to Components

## Where to test it?

I setted up a jsFiddle to fork. 
It contains the latest versions of jQuery, Underscore, BackboneJS and BackboneKIT.

Inheritance
===========

Pretend to have this situation:

- Character
	- GoodCharacter
		- Wizard
	- EvilCharacter
		- Sorcerer

Every _characters_ have a name and some logic to display itself.
